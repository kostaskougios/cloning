or the whole project and select "Run As > JUnit Test".

Sonatype repository, you will need to run:

mvn clean package gpg:sign repository:bundle-create

You will need to enter the passphrase for your private GPG key at some point.
Please do not forget to distribute it to hkp://pgp.mit.edu if the signed
bundle is to be accepted in Maven Central!


to deploy to sonatype:

mvn -P sonatype-deploy -Dgpg.passphrase=X
